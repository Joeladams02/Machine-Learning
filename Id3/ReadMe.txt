I have been reading through the fantastic book 'The 100 page machine learning book' by Andriy Burkov. The section on Decision Tree Learning confused me on a first reading and so I felt the need to look into it further. This led me through the QR code in the book and through my own research to a great website by Ben Kuhn, which provided the dataset I used, and an article Tareq Rahmen Joy which helped talk me through the algorithm. Using these resources I have been able to produce a model which has accuracy of 93.3%. 

It is a fairly fundamental algorithm with no optimisation techniques employed such as backtracking, however with the relative basicness of the data provided i decided it was unnecassary.

Overall, the project has helped me understand fundamental concepts within machine learning such as the informational concept of entropy and information gain that follows from that, as well as the use of both a trainin dataset and then a test dataset.
