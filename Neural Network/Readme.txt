I worked closely with the tutorial on keras to build this model which allows me to download a picture of a daisy, dandelion, rose, tulip or sunflower and it will identify the image.
This was a difficult project as it is my first exposure to keras and tensorflow but i made sure i followed each line in the tutorial and expanded upon their work.
Moving forward, i would like to research more into architectureds of neural networks and move away from tutorials into my own networks.
